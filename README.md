# "Active US Businesses Analysis"

Welcome to the "Active US Businesses Analysis" repository! This project focuses on providing insights into active businesses registered \
with the Office of Finance in the United States. In this project, I aim to understand which types of businesses are most and least active. 
This helps us learn about different business categories and can be useful for startup entrepreneurs by utilizing SQL to clean, analyze, and visualize the provided data.

## Project Overview
### Data Source

The data used in this project is obtained from the Office of Finance and contains a listing of all active businesses registered in the United States. An "active" business is defined as a registered business whose owner has not reported a cessation of business operations. The dataset is updated on a monthly basis, ensuring that you're always accessing the most recent information.

## Analysis Goals

I leverage SQL queries to gain insights into the active businesses dataset. My analysis focuses on several key aspects:

1. NAICS Classification: I classify businesses according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. This classification helps us categorize businesses into different sectors and industries.

2. Business Distribution: I calculate the percentage of businesses operating within each NAICS code. This provides a high-level overview of which industries have the most significant presence among active businesses.

3. Top and Bottom Businesses: By identifying the top and bottom 10 businesses, we uncover which businesses are thriving and which are struggling within the current economic landscape.

4. Average Years in Operation: I analyze the data to determine the average number of years each business has been in operation. This gives us insights into the longevity of businesses across different industries.


## Conclusion


Understanding the number of businesses that are currently operating can help startups in various ways:

1. Knowing the Competition: If there are many businesses in a field, it might be tough for new businesses to succeed. Fewer businesses might mean a chance for new ideas.

2. Seeing Trends: If more businesses are starting in a certain area, it could mean people want those products or services. Startups can choose industries that are growing.

3. Finding Gaps: If only a few businesses are in an industry, startups could find new ideas to stand out.

4. Learning from Competitors: Knowing what types of businesses are common can help startups plan how to be different and attract customers.

5. Seeing Business Lifespan: Checking how long businesses last in an industry shows if it's a good choice for the long term.

6. Adapting to Changes: If fewer businesses are in an industry, it could be changing. Startups can change their plans to match what's happening.

By understanding active businesses, startups can plan better and have a higher chance of success.
